 * Collection of static dictionary words.

 * <p>Dictionary content is loaded from binary resource when {@link #getData()} is executed for the
 * first time. Consequently, it saves memory and CPU in case dictionary is not required.
 *
 * <p>One possible drawback is that multiple threads that need dictionary data may be blocked (only
 * once in each classworld). To avoid this, it is enough to call {@link #getData()} proactively.
